# PUBG Manager
*[PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS](www.playbattlegrounds.com) is a multiplayer shooter featuring 100 players duking it out on an island, searching for battle equipment and surviving until one player (or team) remains.*

**PUBG Manager** is an idle/management game where you recruit virtual players and send them out to play simulated matches. Players in your roster have individual stats, including weapon proficiencies and skills.

## Incremental Game Flow
Inspired by incremental/idle games, your progress is mostly cumulative and self-propelling. The overall game progression may look something like this:

* Recruit players to create a team
* Deploy your team to play and win matches
* Improve player stats
* Recruit more players for more teams
* Establish online presence with streaming and social media
* Become endorsed by sponsors
